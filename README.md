Mzumbe University Building & Estate Maintenance Management System (MU-BEMMS)

*Students and staff have been stuck using the same broken or misshapen facilities over and over without signs of anything being fixed or replaced.
*The current process involving taking forms and filling them out does not seem to be very effective with dealing with all the requested areas that need such repairs.
*Therefore, the core problem is the prolonged time taken by the building and estate department in responding to and fixing the requested facilities across campus, billing students accordingly and keeping records of which facility needs the most preventive maintenance based on requests.
